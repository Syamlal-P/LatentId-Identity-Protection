ABSTRACT
The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has significantly increased the risk of unauthorized identity misuse through deepfakes and AI-driven image manipulation. Modern generative models, including diffusion-based and multimodal AI systems, can reconstruct, alter, or repurpose human facial identity from publicly shared images with minimal effort. Existing defense mechanisms primarily rely on post-generation detection or model-specific adversarial attacks, which are often reactive, computationally expensive, or inaccessible to general users. This creates a critical need for a practical, user-centric approach to identity protection that operates independently of specific AI architectures.
LatentId presents a model-agnostic, preemptive digital identity protection system designed to safeguard facial images before they are exposed to generative AI platforms. Instead of targeting internal components of AI models, LatentId operates at the image processing level by applying identity-preserving transformations that subtly alter machine-interpretable features while maintaining complete visual fidelity for human viewers. The system ensures that protected images appear unchanged to the human eye while reducing the effectiveness of AI-based identity extraction, reconstruction, and semantic manipulation.
The proposed system follows a structured pipeline consisting of image upload, automated face detection and alignment, identity-safe feature transformation, and ultra-high-quality output generation. Emphasis is placed on preserving original resolution, color depth, and structural similarity, ensuring that the protected image remains suitable for real-world use such as social media sharing. The solution is designed to function without access to AI model internals, gradient optimization, or cloud-based GPU dependency, making it lightweight, scalable, and ethically aligned with privacy-by-design principles.
LatentId aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AI defense mechanisms and real-world usability by providing an accessible, non-destructive, and future-proof identity protection framework. The system is suitable for deployment as a web-based application and holds relevance for individuals, journalists, content creators, and privacy-conscious users seeking proactive defense against non-consensual AI-generated identity misuse.
